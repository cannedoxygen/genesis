## Project Overview

AIKIRA: GENESIS PROTOCOL is a web-based interactive puzzle adventure that takes players on a journey to decode the past and uncover lost dinosaur DNA before competing DAOs get there first. Players explore beautifully illustrated cryptic environments, solve puzzles, and uncover lore as they progress through the game.

The game is built on p5.js and deployed on Vercel, with Base Network integration for NFT rewards that can be traded for $AIKIRA tokens.

## Game Narrative

> The wolves have been unearthed. Elon tweeted about mammoths. But the real signal points deeperâ€”back 65 million years. Aikira and Cliza, two sentient agents of an ancient protocol, awaken with a new mission: decode the past, uncover lost DNA, and restore the Genesis Sequenceâ€¦ before the meatbrain DAOs get there first.
